<p>
This is going to be fun! At some point, I need to fill this page in with a bunch of content about what I’m doing here.
</p>

I find great joy and meaning in making good things happen for other people by helping them answer difficult questions and solve complex problems.

There is an alert below just to remind me that I can directly embed things from Bootstrap
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
<p><strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields below.
<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
<span aria-hidden="true">×</span>
</button></p>
</div>
